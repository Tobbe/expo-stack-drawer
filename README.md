# Android Drawer Issue

After a while (sometimes right away) I have to press the drawer items multiple
times to trigger the navigation. The press animation works perfectly, but no
navigation is actually triggered. What am I doing wrong?

# iOS Drawer Issue

I often have to press the drawer icon twice to open the drawer. What am I doing
wrong?
